    <string name="TutorialMessage_Start">Greetings, Commander. Your tutorial mission is about to start. Protect the starbase and eliminate all the enemies.</string>
    <string name="TutorialMessage1">Well done!
The red bar is armor. When armor is gone, the ship will explode. An energy shield is not as hard as armor, but it can regenerate over time.
Use these modules to upgrade the starbase:</string>
    <string name="TutorialMessage2">The yellow bar is the energy. Energy is very important for every ship. It is generated by reactors and accumulated in fuel cells. Put these modules into the starbase.</string>
    <string name="TutorialMessage3">The starbase can be very helpful in battle, as it can also attack the enemies. Try to install these cannons.</string>
    <string name="TutorialMessage4">There is a mercenary ship nearby. Go and hire a mercenary.</string>
    <string name="TutorialMessage4_1">Now assign him to one of your ships.</string>
